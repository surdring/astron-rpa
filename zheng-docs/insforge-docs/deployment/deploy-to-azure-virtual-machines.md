# [​](#-deploying-insforge-to-azure-virtual-machines-extended-guide) 📖 Deploying InsForge to Azure Virtual Machines (Extended Guide)

This guide provides comprehensive, step-by-step instructions for deploying, managing, and securing InsForge on an Azure Virtual Machine (VM) using Docker Compose.

This cloud walkthrough is community-maintained and can lag the latest InsForge release. The canonical, always-current setup is the `deploy/docker-compose/` directory in the [InsForge repo](https://github.com/InsForge/InsForge).

## [​](#prerequisites) Prerequisites

* An active **Azure account**.
* An **SSH client** to connect to the virtual machine.
* Basic familiarity with the **Linux command line**.

---

## [​](#step-1--create-an-azure-virtual-machine) Step 1: 🖥️ Create an Azure Virtual Machine

1. **Log in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/)** and navigate to **Virtual machines**.
2. Click **+ Create** > **Azure virtual machine**.
3. **Basics Tab:**
   * **Resource Group:** Create a new one (e.g., `insforge-rg`).
   * **Virtual machine name:** `insforge-vm`.
   * **Image:** **Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS** or newer.
   * **Size:** `Standard_B2s` (2 vCPUs, 4 GiB memory) is a good start. For production, consider `Standard_B4ms` (4 vCPUs, 16 GiB memory).
   * **Authentication type:** **SSH public key**.
   * **SSH public key source:** **Generate new key pair**. Name it `insforge-key`.
4. **Networking Tab:**
   * In the **Network security group** section, click **Create new**.
   * Add the following **inbound port rules** to allow traffic:
     + `22` (SSH)
     + `80` (HTTP for Nginx)
     + `443` (HTTPS for Nginx/SSL)
     + `7130` (InsForge API and dashboard)
5. **Review and Create:**
   * Click **Review + create**, then **Create**.
   * When prompted, **Download private key and create resource**. Save the `.pem` file securely.
   * Once deployed, find and copy your VM’s **Public IP address**.

---

## [​](#step-2--connect-and-set-up-the-server) Step 2: ⚙️ Connect and Set Up the Server

1. **Connect via SSH:**
   Open your terminal, give your key the correct permissions, and connect to the VM.

   ```
   chmod 400 /path/to/your/insforge-key.pem
   ssh -i /path/to/your/insforge-key.pem azureuser@<your-vm-public-ip>
   ```
2. **Update System Packages:**

   ```
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
   ```
3. **Install Docker:**
   Follow the official, up-to-date instructions on the Docker website to install Docker Engine on Ubuntu:
   **<https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/>**
4. **Add Your User to the Docker Group:**
   This step allows you to run Docker commands without `sudo`.

   ```
   # Add your user to the docker group
   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

   # Apply the group changes
   newgrp docker
   ```

   Verify it works. This command should now run without `sudo`:

   ```
   docker ps
   ```

   > 💡 **Note:** If `docker ps` doesn’t work, log out of your SSH session and log back in, then try again.
   > ⚠️ **Security Note:** Adding a user to the `docker` group grants them root-equivalent privileges. This is acceptable for a single-user VM but be cautious on shared systems.
5. **Install Git:**

   ```
   sudo apt install git -y
   ```

---

## [​](#step-3--deploy-insforge) Step 3: 🚀 Deploy InsForge

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   Navigate to your home directory and clone the InsForge project.

   ```
   cd ~
   git clone https://github.com/InsForge/InsForge.git
   cd InsForge/deploy/docker-compose
   ```
2. **Create Environment Configuration:**
   Create your `.env` file from the example and open it for editing.

   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   nano .env
   ```

   `.env.example` lists every supported variable with comments. For a basic deployment you only need to set a few. Set these values and update the API URLs to your VM’s public IP:

   ```
   # Required
   JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key-here-must-be-32-char-or-above
   ROOT_ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
   ROOT_ADMIN_PASSWORD=change-this-password
   POSTGRES_PASSWORD=change-this-password

   # API URLs (replace with your VM public IP or domain)
   API_BASE_URL=http://<your-vm-public-ip>:7130
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://<your-vm-public-ip>:7130

   # Optional
   # ENCRYPTION_KEY falls back to JWT_SECRET if left empty
   ENCRYPTION_KEY=
   # OPENROUTER_API_KEY=
   # VERCEL_TOKEN=
   # GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
   ```

   The rest of `.env.example` covers optional features (OpenRouter, Vercel deployments, OAuth providers). Leave those blank unless you need them.
   > **Generate a Secure JWT Secret:** Run this on your VM and paste the result into `JWT_SECRET`:
   >
   > ```
   > openssl rand -base64 32
   > ```
3. **Start InsForge Services:**
   Pull the Docker images and start all services in the background.

   ```
   docker compose up -d
   ```
4. **Verify Services:**
   Check that all four containers are running.

   ```
   docker compose ps
   ```

   You should see the `postgres`, `postgrest`, `insforge`, and `deno` services running.

---

## [​](#step-4--access-your-insforge-instance) Step 4: 🔑 Access Your InsForge Instance

1. **Test Backend API:**
   Use `curl` to check the health endpoint.

   ```
   curl http://<your-vm-public-ip>:7130/api/health
   ```

   You should see a response like: `{"status":"ok", ...}`
2. **Access Dashboard:**
   Open your browser and navigate to: `http://<your-vm-public-ip>:7130`
   Log in with the `ROOT_ADMIN_USERNAME` and `ROOT_ADMIN_PASSWORD` you set in your `.env` file.

---

## [​](#step-5--configure-domain-optional-but-recommended) Step 5: 🌐 Configure Domain (Optional but Recommended)

1. **Update DNS Records:**
   In your domain provider’s DNS settings, add two **A records** pointing to your VM’s Public IP address:
   * `api.yourdomain.com` → `<your-vm-public-ip>`
   * `app.yourdomain.com` → `<your-vm-public-ip>`
2. **Install and Configure Nginx as a Reverse Proxy:**

   ```
   sudo apt install nginx -y
   sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/insforge
   ```

   Paste the following configuration:

   ```
   # Backend API
   server {
       listen 80;
       server_name api.yourdomain.com;
       location / {
           proxy_pass http://localhost:7130;
           proxy_set_header Host $host;
           proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
           proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
           proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
       }
   }
   # Frontend Dashboard (served by the same port as the API)
   server {
       listen 80;
       server_name app.yourdomain.com;
       location / {
           proxy_pass http://localhost:7130;
           proxy_http_version 1.1;
           proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
           proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
           proxy_set_header Host $host;
       }
   }
   ```

   Enable the configuration and reload Nginx:

   ```
   sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/insforge /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
   sudo nginx -t
   sudo systemctl reload nginx
   ```
3. **Install SSL Certificate with Certbot:**

   ```
   # Install Certbot for Nginx
   sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx -y
   # Obtain SSL certificates and configure Nginx automatically
   sudo certbot --nginx -d api.yourdomain.com -d app.yourdomain.com
   ```

   Follow the prompts. Certbot will handle the rest.
4. **Update `.env` with HTTPS URLs:**
   Edit your `.env` file and update the URLs.

   ```
   cd ~/InsForge
   nano .env
   ```

   Change the URLs to `https`:

   ```
   API_BASE_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com
   ```

   Restart the services for the changes to take effect:

   ```
   docker compose down && docker compose up -d
   ```

---

## [​](#-management-&-maintenance) 🔧 Management & Maintenance

* **View Logs:** `docker compose logs -f` (all services) or `docker compose logs -f insforge` (specific service).
* **Stop Services:** `docker compose down`
* **Restart Services:** `docker compose restart`
* **Update InsForge:** Run these from `~/InsForge/deploy/docker-compose`. The images are prebuilt, so pull the latest tags instead of rebuilding.

  ```
  cd ~/InsForge/deploy/docker-compose
  git -C ~/InsForge pull origin main
  docker compose pull && docker compose up -d
  ```
* **Backup Database:** Run from `~/InsForge/deploy/docker-compose`.

  ```
  docker compose exec postgres pg_dump -U postgres insforge > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql
  ```

## [​](#-troubleshooting) 🐛 Troubleshooting

* **Services Won’t Start:** Check `docker compose logs` for errors. Ensure you have enough disk space (`df -h`) and memory (`free -h`).
* **Port Already in Use:** Check which process is using the port with `sudo netstat -tulpn | grep :7130`.
* **Out of Memory:** Consider upgrading your Azure VM to a size with more RAM.

## [​](#-cost-estimation) 📊 Cost Estimation

> **Disclaimer:** Prices are estimates based on Pay-As-You-Go rates in a common region (e.g., East US) and can vary. Always check the official [Azure Pricing Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator/) for the most accurate information. On Azure, you pay for the VM’s resources (CPU, RAM, Storage), which are shared by all the Docker services you run on it.

### [​](#free-tier-for-testing) Free Tier (for Testing)

* **Cost:** **~$0/month** for the first 12 months.
* **Resources:** Azure provides a free tier that includes 750 hours/month of a `B1s` burstable VM.
* **Limitations:** This VM has very limited resources (1 vCPU, 1 GiB RAM) and may run slowly. It’s suitable only for basic testing and familiarization, not for active development or production.

### [​](#starter-setup-for-development-&-small-projects) Starter Setup (for Development & Small Projects)

* **Cost:** **~30−30 - 30−40/month**
* **Resources:** This estimate is for a `Standard_B2s` VM (2 vCPU, 4 GiB RAM) running all the InsForge Docker containers.
* **Breakdown:** The cost primarily consists of the VM compute hours. It also includes the OS disk storage and a static public IP address. This single VM runs your database, backend, Deno, and all other services.

### [​](#production-setup-for-scalability-&-reliability) Production Setup (for Scalability & Reliability)

For production, you can choose between an all-in-one, larger VM or a more robust setup using managed services.

* **Option A: All-in-One Larger VM**
  + **Cost:** **~150−150 - 150−170/month**
  + **Resources:** A more powerful `Standard_B4ms` VM (4 vCPU, 16 GiB RAM) to handle higher traffic and all services.
  + **Pros:** Simple to manage, consolidated cost.
  + **Cons:** Database and application share resources, which can create performance bottlenecks. Scaling requires upgrading the entire VM.
* **Option B: Managed Services (Recommended for Production)**
  + **Cost:** **~$120+/month** (highly variable)
  + **Resources:**
    - **Application VM:** A `Standard_B2s` VM for the app services (InsForge, PostgREST, Deno). `(~$30/month)`
    - **Managed Database:** Use **Azure Database for PostgreSQL** for reliability, automated backups, and scaling. `(~$40+/month for a starter tier)`
  + **Pros:** Highly reliable and scalable. Database performance is isolated and guaranteed. Managed backups and security.
  + **Cons:** More complex setup, costs are distributed across multiple services.

## [​](#-security-best-practices) 🔒 Security Best Practices

* **Change Default Passwords:** Always update admin and database passwords.
* **Enable Firewall:** Use Azure **Network Security Groups (NSGs)** to restrict access to necessary ports and IP addresses.
* **Regular Updates:** Periodically run `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y` and update InsForge.
* **Backup Regularly:** Automate database and configuration backups.
