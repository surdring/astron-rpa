# Razorpay Payments

Copy page

Integrate Razorpay Orders, Subscriptions, manual webhooks, and webhook fulfillment with InsForge.

Copy page

Use the Razorpay integration when you want Razorpay Orders, Razorpay Checkout, Items, Plans, and Subscriptions. Razorpay is not a hosted redirect flow like Stripe Checkout. Your backend creates the provider object, your frontend opens the Razorpay Checkout script, and your backend verifies the returned signature.

## [​](#razorpay-model) Razorpay model

| Razorpay concept | Meaning in InsForge |
| --- | --- |
| Item | Amount-bearing sellable unit. Mirrored in `payments.razorpay_items`. |
| Plan | Recurring subscription definition around an item. Mirrored in `payments.razorpay_plans`. |
| Order | One-time payment object. Created through `POST /api/payments/razorpay/{environment}/orders` and mirrored in `payments.razorpay_orders`. |
| Payment | Provider payment result. Projected into `payments.transactions` from webhooks and sync. |
| Subscription | Razorpay subscription tied to a Plan. Mirrored in `payments.razorpay_subscriptions`. |
| Webhook event | Verified provider event in `payments.webhook_events` with `provider = 'razorpay'`. |

Razorpay does not have a Stripe Billing Portal equivalent. InsForge exposes backend routes to cancel, pause, and resume subscriptions after checking the caller against `payments.razorpay_subscriptions` RLS `UPDATE` policies.
For one-time products, Razorpay Orders can be created with only an amount, currency, and receipt. Still, prefer creating Razorpay Items for sellable products so the catalog is visible in InsForge and Razorpay after sync. Treat Orders as payment attempts, not as your product catalog.

## [​](#setup) Setup

Configure `test` and `live` Razorpay Key ID and Key Secret in Dashboard -> Payments -> Settings or through the admin API. InsForge generates a webhook signing secret if one does not already exist.
Razorpay webhooks must be created manually in the Razorpay Dashboard. Razorpay normal merchant API keys do not support automatic webhook registration.

1. Open Dashboard -> Payments -> Settings -> Webhooks.
2. Copy the Razorpay Webhook URL and Webhook Secret.
3. In the Razorpay Dashboard, create a webhook with the copied URL and secret.
4. Select the events InsForge handles.
5. Save the webhook and complete a test payment to confirm delivery.

Razorpay can only deliver webhooks to a public HTTPS URL. Localhost URLs need a public tunnel or a deployed backend.
Handled events:

* `payment.authorized`
* `payment.captured`
* `payment.failed`
* `order.paid`
* `invoice.paid`
* `invoice.expired`
* `refund.created`
* `refund.processed`
* `refund.failed`
* `subscription.created`
* `subscription.activated`
* `subscription.charged`
* `subscription.updated`
* `subscription.cancelled`
* `subscription.paused`
* `subscription.resumed`
* `subscription.halted`
* `subscription.completed`
* `subscription.expired`

## [​](#one-time-orders) One-time orders

Create an app-owned pending order first. Then create a Razorpay Order with the current InsForge user token.

```
const { data, error } = await insforge.payments.razorpay.createOrder('test', {
  amount: 50000,
  currency: 'INR',
  receipt: 'order_123',
  subject: { type: 'team', id: 'team_123' },
  customerEmail: 'buyer@example.com',
  notes: { order_id: 'order_123' }
});

if (error) throw error;
```

The SDK wraps `POST /api/payments/razorpay/{environment}/orders`. The response includes `checkoutOptions` with Razorpay Checkout-native fields such as `key` and `order_id`. Load `https://checkout.razorpay.com/v1/checkout.js` in the frontend and pass those options to `new Razorpay(options).open()`.
If your fulfillment trigger reads `notes.order_id`, pass `notes: { order_id: ... }` when creating the Order or Subscription.
After Razorpay Checkout returns `razorpay_order_id`, `razorpay_payment_id`, and `razorpay_signature`, verify the signature on the backend:

```
await insforge.payments.razorpay.verifyOrder('test', {
  orderId: response.razorpay_order_id,
  paymentId: response.razorpay_payment_id,
  signature: response.razorpay_signature
});
```

Signature verification proves the immediate Checkout callback came from Razorpay. Durable order fulfillment should still run from verified Razorpay webhook events.

## [​](#subscriptions) Subscriptions

Create or sync a Razorpay Plan before creating subscriptions. A Plan is not the same thing as a Stripe Price. It is a recurring definition around a Razorpay Item.

```
const { data, error } = await insforge.payments.razorpay.createSubscription('test', {
  planId: 'plan_123',
  totalCount: 12,
  subject: { type: 'team', id: 'team_123' },
  customerEmail: 'buyer@example.com'
});

if (error) throw error;
```

The SDK wraps `POST /api/payments/razorpay/{environment}/subscriptions`. The response includes `checkoutOptions.subscription_id`. Open Razorpay Checkout with that subscription ID. After Checkout returns `razorpay_subscription_id`, `razorpay_payment_id`, and `razorpay_signature`, verify the authorization payment:

```
await insforge.payments.razorpay.verifySubscription('test', {
  subscriptionId: response.razorpay_subscription_id,
  paymentId: response.razorpay_payment_id,
  signature: response.razorpay_signature
});
```

Manage subscriptions through backend routes:

```
await insforge.payments.razorpay.cancelSubscription('test', 'sub_123', {
  cancelAtCycleEnd: false
});

await insforge.payments.razorpay.pauseSubscription('test', 'sub_123');
await insforge.payments.razorpay.resumeSubscription('test', 'sub_123');
```

Subscription creation evaluates `INSERT` policies on `payments.razorpay_subscriptions`. Cancel, pause, and resume evaluate `UPDATE` policies on the same table. PostgreSQL also applies `SELECT` policies to rows returned by `INSERT/UPDATE ... RETURNING`, so make the same subject visible to the caller when a policy probe needs to return the row. Grant users only the table access needed for policy checks; provider mutations still run through the backend.

## [​](#webhooks-and-fulfillment) Webhooks and fulfillment

Razorpay’s Checkout callback and signature verification are not a replacement for webhooks. Use `payments.webhook_events` for fulfillment triggers. Do not attach fulfillment triggers to provider mirror tables such as `payments.razorpay_subscriptions`; sync and webhook projection can update those rows independently of provider event delivery.

```
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.fulfill_razorpay_order()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  IF NEW.provider = 'razorpay'
     AND NEW.event_type IN ('payment.captured', 'order.paid', 'invoice.paid')
     AND NEW.processing_status = 'processed'
     AND COALESCE(
       NEW.payload -> 'payload' -> 'payment' -> 'entity' -> 'notes' ->> 'order_id',
       NEW.payload -> 'payload' -> 'invoice' -> 'entity' -> 'notes' ->> 'order_id'
     ) IS NOT NULL THEN
    UPDATE public.orders
    SET status = 'paid',
        paid_at = COALESCE(NEW.processed_at, NOW())
    WHERE id::text = COALESCE(
      NEW.payload -> 'payload' -> 'payment' -> 'entity' -> 'notes' ->> 'order_id',
      NEW.payload -> 'payload' -> 'invoice' -> 'entity' -> 'notes' ->> 'order_id'
    )
      AND status = 'pending';
  END IF;

  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

CREATE TRIGGER fulfill_razorpay_order_from_webhook
  AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE ON payments.webhook_events
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE FUNCTION public.fulfill_razorpay_order();
```

## [​](#sync-and-dashboard-state) Sync and dashboard state

Razorpay sync mirrors Items, Plans, Customers, Subscriptions, Invoices, and Payments. Invoices and payments feed the `payments.transactions` dashboard/reporting projection. Transactions include provider reference IDs such as payment, invoice, order, subscription, and refund IDs so you can inspect the source record in the Razorpay Dashboard.
Keep user-facing order, credit, and entitlement state in your own app tables. Treat `payments.transactions` as dashboard/reporting state, not as the primary business workflow.
